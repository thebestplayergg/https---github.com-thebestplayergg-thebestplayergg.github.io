    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of sugar </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 cups milk</li> 
        <li>1/2 vegetable oil (or melted butter)</li> <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <li> **Preheat Waffle Iron:**
         - Preheat your waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
      
       <li>**Mix Dry Ingredients:**
         - In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
      
       <li>**Combine Wet Ingredients:**
         - In another bowl, beat the eggs. Then add the milk, vegetable oil (or melted butter), and vanilla extract, and mix well.</li>   
      
       <li>**Combine Wet and Dry Mixtures:**
         - Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined. The batter will be a bit lumpy, but that's okay. Don't overmix.</li>
      
       <li>**Cook Waffles:**
         - Lightly grease the waffle iron with non-stick spray or a small amount of vegetable oil. Pour the recommended amount of batter (check your waffle iron’s instructions) onto the hot waffle iron. Close the lid and cook until the waffles are golden brown and crisp. This usually takes about 3-5 minutes, depending on your waffle iron.</li>
      
       <li>**Serve:**
         - Carefully remove the waffle and serve immediately with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or a sprinkle of powdered sugar.</li>
      
     <li>Tips:</li>
      <li>**Keep Waffles Warm:** If you're making a batch, keep the cooked waffles warm in a single layer on a baking sheet in a 200°F (90°C) oven.</li>
      
       <li>**Customize:** Add a cup of chocolate chips, blueberries, or nuts to the batter for extra flavor.</li>
      
      <li>Enjoy your waffles!</li>
